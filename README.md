# Gain-Scheduled-LPV-Control Vs Non-linear MPC
In this work, we developed Robust LPV-based Adaptive Lateral and Longitudinal Control for Autonomous Vehicles (AV) in dangerous situations. Comparison with NMPC was done for benchmarking.
Specifically, we wrote a MATLAB code to design a polytopic H-infinity controller to improve adaptability to vehicles moving at high speed turns on slippery roads
The gain-scheduling approach was utilized to implement the developed controller in SIMULINK.

The following are some essential files associated with the work:
